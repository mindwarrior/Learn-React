<h1>Thinking in React</h1>
These are some notes that helped me ingrain the basic concepts of React.

## Introduction

React is a javascript library to build fast and interactive user interfaces.
React is not a framework it handles only View part of the MVC framework.
Frameworks like Angular on other hand do everything in one package. With React 
we have to use other libraries like router, redux and so on.
